## Hi I'm Eli <img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1303154/88677602-1635ba80-d120-11ea-84d8-d263ba5fc3c0.gif" width="28px" alt="hi">

I'm Eli Hatton, a student developer and the co-founder/co owner of [ZincSoft](zincsoft.dev). I enjoy programming (*of course*), running, video games, reading, and movies. I also find math, physics, and finance very interesting. I am self-taught, and codecademy.com helped a lot with my learning. 

:mailbox: Contact me!
